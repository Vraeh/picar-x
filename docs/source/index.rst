The PiCar-X is an AI-driven self-driving robot car for the Raspberry Pi platform, upon which the Raspberry Pi acts as the control center. 
The PiCar-Xâ€™s 2-axis camera module, ultrasonic module, and line tracking modules can provide the functions of color/face/traffic-signs detection, 
automatic obstacle avoidance, automatic line tracking, etc.

PiCar-X has two programming languages: Blockly and Python. No matter what language you program in, you'll find detailed steps to teach you everything from configuring the Raspberry Pi to running the relevant example code.

* :ref:`play_python`

    * This chapter is for those who enjoy programming in Python or want to learn the Python language.
    * To get Picar-X working properly, you must install some libraries first.
    * The Raspberry Pi configuration and samples code for the PiCar-X are provided in this chapter.
    * An APP - SunFounder Controller is also provided to allow you to remotely control the PiCar-X on your mobile device.


* :ref:`play_ezblock`

    * In this section, you will use a Blockly based APP, Ezblock Studio, which, like Scratch, allows you to drag and drop blocks to make Picar-X move.
    * It is required to reinstall the SD card with the operating system we provide with pre-installed Ezblock environment before programming. It is recommended to use a new or unused TF card for this section.
    * Ezblock Studio is available for nearly all types of devices, including Macs, PCs, and Androids.
    * Ezblock Studio is a good choice if you are 6-12 years old, or don't have programming skills, or want to test Picar-X quickly.



**About the display language**

In addition to English, we are working on other languages for this course. Please contact service@sunfounder.com if you are interested in helping, and we will give you a free product in return. 
In the meantime, we recommend using Google Translate to convert English to the language you want to see.

The steps are as follows.

* In this course page, right-click and select **Translate to xx**. If the current language is not what you want, you can change it later.
