Text to Speech
===========================

Before using the Text-to-Speech (TTS) functions, first activate the speaker so that it will be enabled and can make sounds.

Run ``i2samp.sh`` in the **picar-x** folder, and this script will install everything needed to use i2s amplifier.

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/picar-x
    sudo bash i2samp.sh

There will be several prompts asking to confirm the request. Respond to all prompts with a **Y**. After the changes have been made to the Raspberry Pi system, the computer will need to reboot for these changes to take effect.

After rebooting, run the ``i2samp.sh`` script again to test the amplifier. If a sound successfully plays from the speaker, the configuration is complete.

**Run the Code**

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/picar-x/example
    sudo python3 tts_example.py
    
After running the code, PiCar-X will say \"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Good bye\", \"Nice to meet you\".

**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``picar-x/example``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import TTS


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        words = ["Hello", "Hi", "Good bye", "Nice to meet you"]
        tts_robot = TTS()
        for i in words:
            print(i)
            tts_robot.say(i)


**How it works?** 

The `eSpeak <http://espeak.sourceforge.net/>`_ software is used to implement the functions of TTS.

Import the TTS module in robot_hat, which encapsulates functions that convert text to speech.

.. code-block::

    from robot_hat import TTS

Create a string list ``words`` , then create an instantiated object of the TTS() class ``tts_robot`` , and finally use the ``tts_robot.say()`` function to speak the words in the list in speech.

.. code-block::

    words = ["Hello", "Hi", "Good bye", "Nice to meet you"]
    tts_robot = TTS()
    for i in words:
        print(i)
        tts_robot.say(i)
